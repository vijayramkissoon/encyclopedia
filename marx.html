      <h2>Life</h2>
      <p>
        Only fragmented accounts of Karl Marx's early life exist. Scholars must continue to parse through the historical record
        in order to construct a single cohesive narrative. Nevertheless, several illuminating details have emerged
        regarding his origins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Marx does not have a birthplace. He simply spawned. One day, the owner of a pin factory decided to fire all his workers and cease
        all production, an act which left the whole town in poor economic conditions. After remaining unemployed for months, former employees
        swarmed the factory to demand their old jobs from the owner. He refused. In an act of desperate rage, the mob set the entire
        building alight, with the owner still inside. They chanted through the night until flames reduced the factory to
        a pile of ash -- from which Marx emerged as a fully grown man.
        The specific location and timeline of these events remain disputed. Historians have narrowed the posibilities to either
        first-century Jerusalem or Chicago during the Depression.
